Masking and Integration Cuts
============================

After opening Xi-Cam, click on the Viewer.

Masking
=======
Masking is a useful technique that allows users to "mask" out unnecessary pixels in the image. The masked areas of the
scan will not be considered during azimuthal integration.

Automatic Masking
=================
To automatically mask Pilatus and Rayonix detectors, click on the second button on the center menu above the image.

Manual Masking
==============
It is also possible to manually mask a polygon. This is particularly helpful to mask beam stops and shadows. To do this,
click on the third button on the center menu above the image and click on the first tab. A polygon will appear on the
screen; drag the polygon to the area you would like to mask. Change the size and shape of the polygon by dragging the
squares on the corners of the polygon. Click on the second button on the center menu above the image to see the masking.

Integration Cuts
================
Another feature of Xi-cam are integration cuts. Integration cuts can be done vertically, horizontally, at a particular
angle, or as a line. Integration cuts restrict area of integration to within that cut. To analyze cuts, use the
integration panel.

Vertical Cut:
=============
To add a vertical cut to the image, click on the vertical line button. Drag the edges of the box to place it in the
interested section. The z space is helpful to analyze vertical cuts.

Horizontal Cut:
===============
To add a vertical cut to the image, click on the horizontal line button. Drag the edges of the box to place it in the
interested section. The x space is helpful to analyze horizontal cuts.

Line Cut:

To add a vertical cut to the image, click on the line cut button. Drag the edges of the line to place it in the
interested section. The q space is helpful to analyze line cuts.
